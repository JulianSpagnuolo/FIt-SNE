Title: FFT-accelerated Interpolation-based tSNE (FIt-SNE)
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2018-03-27
Description: An R wrapper around a fast Fourier transform-accelerated interpolation-based t-SNE (FIt-SNE),
    which dramatically accelerates the computation of t-SNE. The most time-consuming step of t-SNE is a convolution
    that is here, accelerated by interpolating onto an equispaced grid and subsequently using the fast Fourier transform
    to perform the convolution. The computation of input similarities in high dimensions is also optimised using multi-threaded
    approximate nearest neighbors. A further modification to t-SNE called "late exaggeration", allows for easier identification
    of clusters in t-SNE embeddings. See Linderman GC., Rachh M., et al (2017) <arXiv:1712.09005>
